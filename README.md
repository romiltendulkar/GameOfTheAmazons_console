# GameOfTheAmazons_console
This is a Command Line program that was developed for one of my classes at DigiPen.
The project was developed for a Combinatorial Games Math class
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Amazons
The user is expected to input 10x10 boards of Game of the Amazons.

A Sample board is included as StartBoard.txt
Integer values are input into a text file for the board, 1 is to represent the white pieces, 2 represents the black pieces and 3 represents spots on the board that have been blocked out. 0 represents the spots where moves can still be made

The game can be played by a human against AI or between two AIs to test out the program.
